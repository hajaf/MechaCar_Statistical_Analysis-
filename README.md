# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis-
•	According to our results, vehicle_length and ground_clerance (as well as intercept) are statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to the linear model.

•	Adding all the slopes
-.01 + 6.267+0.001+0.069+3.546-3.411=6.462 which is not zero

•	The R squared is 0.7149

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Within Lot 1 and 2 we see that to be true as both variances are less that 10 however in lot 3 we see that the variance is 170 which means the spring may not need to be used.

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils
I we take 0.05 as are p value the 
•	With manufacturing lot 1 the P Value provided is more than 0.05 meaning we reject the null hypothesis. 
•	With manufacturing lot 1 the P Value provided is more than 0.05 meaning  we keep the null hypothesis. 
•	With manufacturing lot 3 the P Value provided is less than 0.05 meaning  we reject  the null.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition
An ANOVA that helps find out whether the differences between groups of data are statistically significant. Let’s take cost an example. The null hypothesis would be that there is no statistical difference in cost of production of competition and MechaCar. While The Alternative hypothesis would be that there is a statistical difference in the cost of production of competition and MechaCar. The data needed for this test would be products from each company and the cost to product each product.
